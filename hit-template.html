<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 11.7px; line-height: 20.8px;">Read the linked article and the comment thread below and choose the best options for the conversation&#39;s Type, Agreement, and Constructiveness in the questions that follow.</span></p>

<p><strong>1. Type (Please choose as many as apply, but try to stick to capturing the overall tone and topic of the discussion)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Argumentative</strong> - A &quot;back-and-forth,&quot; argumentative discussion without much credit given by either side. Statements will often be <strong>adamant or forceful, but not particularly mean or hateful</strong>. Lots of point and counterpoint, not necessarily with any conclusion. There might be one or two mean or insulting comments.</li>
	<li><strong>Flamewar</strong> - Mainly <strong>insults</strong> and <strong>name calling</strong> - extremely negative. Not constructive or informative.</li>
	<li><strong>Snarky/humorous</strong> - The conversation is mostly snark or jokes that may be on- or off-topic. Users are choosing to engage one another in humor rather than argue or sympathize.</li>
	<li><strong>Positive/respectful</strong> - Conversation is mostly users who are all expressing opinions with respect and empathy.</li>
	<li><strong>Off-Topic / Digression</strong> - Comments are completely irrelevant to article and/or each other; OR users start on topic but veer off in another direction.</li>
	<li><strong>Personal stories</strong> - Users exchange personal anecdotes.</li>
	<li><strong>NA</strong>- Used for conversations that are too short to develop into a conclusive &quot;type&quot; of conversation.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. <strong>Agreement (Please choose only one)</strong><br />
Judge whether the thread:</p>

<ul>
	<li>has <strong>agreement throughout</strong>;</li>
	<li>has <strong>initial disagreement converging to agreement</strong> (convincing);&nbsp;</li>
	<li>has <strong>continual disagreement throughout</strong>;</li>
	<li>has <strong>agreement initially and devolves to disagreement</strong>, or&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>NA</strong> - the thread is too short or has too many digressions to rate the agreement level. NA also covers conversations that have a mix of agreement and disagreement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Constructiveness (Please choose only one)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Constructive</strong> - A conversation or argument <strong>does not have to have a winner or conclusion</strong> to be constructive, as long as there is a clear exchange of ideas, opinions, and information done so somewhat respectfully. A constructive conversation should contain <strong>one or multiple points of agreement and/or disagreement,</strong> all mostly on topic, and be <strong>relatively respectful</strong>. An outsider would find a constructive conversation interesting or informative, <strong>even if there is disagreement between the participants.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Non-constructive</strong> - These are largely unproductive threads. Usually, the initial commenter&#39;s point does not get properly addressed, comments contains few attempts at persuasiveness, and each comment can be taken in isolation.&nbsp; A conversation can also be deemed non-constructive if largely negative (i.e. just back and forth of insults) or &quot;all over the place&quot; in terms of topic.</li>
	<li><strong>NA</strong> - Used for discussions that are too short to determine constructiveness.</li>
</ul>
